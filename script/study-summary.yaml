  Title: |
    A randomized, single ascending dose, Phase I trial to assess the safety, 
    tolerability, and \gls{PK} of once daily oral doses of \drugx\ in healthy adults.
  Phase: '1'
  Short: Randomized, single ascending dose study
  Patients: Healthy
  nSub: 30 \linebreak (5 per DG)
  nDose: Single dose
  D_levels: 5, 10, 25, 100, 150, 200 mg 
  obTime: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 20, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post-dose
  nTime: '15'
  Conc: |
    Single doses of \drugx\ were safe and well tolerated when administered orally.

  Title: |
    A randomized, multiple ascending dose, Phase I trial to assess the safety, 
    tolerability, and \gls{PK} of \drugx\ in healthy adults.
  Phase: '1'
  Short: Randomized, multiple ascending dose study
  Patients: Healthy
  nSub: 50 \linebreak (10 per DG)
  nDose: Multiple doses (BID for 6 days)
  D_levels: 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg
  obTime: |
    \emph{Post-first dose}: 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 (pre-dose) hours.
    \emph{Pre-third dose}: A trough at 24 hours (pre-dose).
    \emph{Post-dose}: Samples were taken approx. 2 hours post-dose ($\pm$ 1.5 hours).
    for doses at 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours.
    \emph{Post-last dose}: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 60, and 84 hours post-dose.
  nTime: '24'
  Conc: |
    Results support the safety and tolerability of single \drugx\ dosing study.
    Multiple, ascending doses of CR845 were generally safe and well tolerated in this patient population.
